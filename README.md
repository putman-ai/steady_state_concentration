# Estimating Steady State Concentration

## Overview
A Python-based analytical tool for modeling steady state concentration levels of medications, with specific application to end-stage palliative care. The model calculates and visualizes concentration levels over time, accounting for factors such as half-life, dosing intervals, and timing variations.

## Background
This tool was developed during a critical period of hospice care to address complex medication management challenges. It arose from a need to optimize dosing schedules when standard protocols proved ineffective, ultimately receiving validation from senior hospice care professionals.

## Features
- Calculates steady state concentration levels for multiple medications
- Visualizes concentration levels over time
- Models the effects of different dosing intervals
- Analyzes impact of timing variations on medication levels
- Supports comparative analysis between different medications

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/steady_state_concentration.git
cd steady_state_concentration

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The main interface is provided through `ssc_analysis.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates key functionality:
- Basic concentration calculations
- Comparative medication analysis
- Timing variation studies
- Custom medication profiles

For programmatic usage, see `examples/example_scenarios.ipynb`.

## Technical Components
- Concentration level calculations using half-life decay models
- Time-series visualization using matplotlib
- Support for multiple medication profiles
- Timing offset analysis for dosing variations

## Implementation Details
- Built using Python with numpy and matplotlib
- Includes visualization of steady state concentrations
- Models both single and comparative medication scenarios
- Supports analysis of timing variations in medication administration

## Important Notice
This tool was developed for analytical purposes in a specific medical context under professional supervision. It is not intended for general medical use or as a replacement for professional medical judgment. Any application of this model should be conducted only under appropriate medical supervision.
