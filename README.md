# Estimating Steady State Concentration
Approximating steady state concentration levels for end-stage hospice patients.

This is by far one of the most difficult things I've ever done; the kaos, pressure and emotions at the time were very high. Six months later it's still difficult to think about it.
Unless you're a medical professional, I don't recommend anyone use this, but it may give you some insight into end-stage dosing approximation.
This was simply a best-effort at the time and I'm sure there are massive gaps in the logic and math.

During my mothers final weeks, she was put on some very strong medication, as is normal with hospice care. Unfortunately she had a very negative reaction to the Roxanol.
Despite their best efforts, the doctors and nurses were never able to land on a tollerable dosing and the time spent waiting on "next-attempts" was typically measured in days. 
Finally out of despiration, I put my data-science hat on, went through all my the notes, and tried to find a logical solution that was better then just "stronger and more."

This lead to some drama between myself and the nurses and I was basically told to stay in my lane. 
Shortly after, the head nurse from the facility came to our house, gave my mother a thurough examination and said:
"She's good, she's doing really good, she's in no pain. Just keep doing what you're doing and let us know what you need."
