# steady_state_concentration
Approximating steady state concentration levels for end-stage hospice patients.

This is by far one of the most difficult things I've ever done; the kaos, pressure and emotions at the time were very high. Six months later it's still difficult to think about it.
Unless you're a medical professional, I don't recommend anyone use this, but it may give you some insight into end-stage dosing approximation.
This was simply a best-effort at the time and I'm sure there are massive gaps in the logic and math. So, again, please don't use this.

During my mothers final weeks, she was put on some very strong medication, as is normal with hospice care. Unfortunately she had a very negative reaction to the Roxanol.
Despite their best efforts, the doctors and nurses were never able to land on a tollerable dosing and the time spent waiting on "next-attempts" was typically measured in days. 
Finally one night out of despiration, I put my data-science hat on, went through all my the notes, and tried to find a logical solution that was better then just "stronger and more."

The next morning when the attending nurse came to our home and asked me to try "this and that", I said "okay", but I want you to look at something.
I showed her this model, ran the numbers and told her precisely when Mom would become ill if she wasn't going to tollerate this new (higher) dosing.
The nurse, who was very good at what she did, seemed offended and spent the next fifteen minutes telling me to stop wasting my time on stuff like this.
Basically, "stay in my lane..."
